# aws1
Practically implementing AWS(EC2, S3) and Terraform. Created this repo for fun to wish my friend Birthday by writing message in HTML.
Uploading image in S3, changing necessary rules so that image is accessible to from all IP.
Then creating EC2 instance with necessary other resources and mount S3 on this instance.
Lastly share the IP to your friend and there you go !
